# YMonad #

This is a collection of scripts for controlling the Yabai window manager for
macOS, so that it behaves more like the XMonad window manager for Linux.

These scripts are implemented in Haskell, and use the Polysemy package to
abstract over side-effects. The real implementation implements these effects by
sending commands to Yabai, whilst the test suite implements a dummy in-memory
window manager.

## Files ##

`Yabai.hs` is the main implementation. It doesn't define `main`, instead it
defines a `mkMain` function which turns a given command (e.g. `swapVisibles`)
into an `IO ()` suitable for using as `main`.

`YabaiTests.hs` defines the test suite, and a `main` to run it.

`default.nix` defines Nix packages for a bunch of scripts (each implemented
using `mkMain`) and a package which collects all of these in a `bin/` directory.

`nixpkgs.nix` defines a known-good version of the nixpkgs repository.

`overlay.nix` is a Nix overlay which exposes the contents of `default.nix` as a
`y-monad` package.

`overlays.nix` defines a list of overlays, including that of `overlay.nix`, but
also one of our dependencies called `nix-helpers`.

`release.nix` exposes y-monad, built with the known-good nixpkgs. Useful for CI.
